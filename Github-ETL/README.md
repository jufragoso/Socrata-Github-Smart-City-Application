This folder contains the processes that aim to get required data from Github. These processes have been developed by using Pentaho Data Integration (http://community.pentaho.com/projects/data-integration/). There are two processes:

-get_opendata_github_data.ktr. .... using the identifier stored in the  USA_CITY_IDS_WITH_THEME_OR_KEYWORD view to look for references in Github, the result of this search is the results_search_open_data.csv (compressed in .zip)...

-get_opendata_github_repositories_and_users.ktr.  the data gathered about the repositories referencing dataset of USA cities is stored in measures_repository.csv....
